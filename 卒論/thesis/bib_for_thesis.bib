The mutual model is used to explain the working principle of magnetic resonance WPT system, while the transfer characteristic expression of distance is obtained by theoretical analysis of the system. On the basis of the above research, further study about improving the system transmission distance is also in the work. Studies have shown that there is an optimal distance point for the 2-coils magnetic resonance WPT system to achieve the maximum voltage gain and output power, and improving the resonance frequency of the system is an effective way to increase transmission distance. Finally, the magnetic resonance WPT system is set up for experimental verification. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analysis.},

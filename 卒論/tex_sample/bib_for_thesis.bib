abstract = {Nanjing electromechanical hydraulic engineering research center Nanjing China Abstract— This paper mainly studies the distance transmission characteristics of magnetic resonance WPT system and methods to improve the transmission distance. The mutual model is used to explain the working principle of magnetic resonance WPT system, while the transfer characteristic expression of distance is obtained by theoretical analysis of the system. On the basis of the above research, further study about improving the system transmission distance is also in the work. Studies have shown that there is an optimal distance point for the 2-coils magnetic resonance WPT system to achieve the maximum voltage gain and output power, and improving the resonance frequency of the system is an effective way to increase transmission distance. Finally, the magnetic resonance WPT system is set up for experimental verification. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {In wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, changes in the receiver position and load resistance affect the output voltage and power efficiency. A receiver-side switching voltage regulator is useful for output voltage regulation, but it cannot be utilized with a DC-DC converter dedicated to conventional maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT). As an MEPT method compatible with a switching voltage regulator and basically without feedback information, we propose MEPT by input control to make the switching voltage regulator undertake the role of the DC-DC converter of a conventional MEPT. To enable the proposed MEPT, we propose two additional essential technologies. One is a system design to remove the instability caused by a switching voltage regulator at the maximum efficiency point. The other is the activation timing of a switching voltage regulator to reach a stable point. Measurements using a 0-Ω power source and a K-inverter validate the proposed methods.},

abstract = {With a good balance between power transfer distance and efficiency, wireless power transfer (WPT) using magnetic resonant coupling is preferred in many applications. Generally, WPT systems are desired to provide constant output voltage with the highest possible efficiency as power supplies. However, the highest efficiency is not achieved by the reported closed-loop WPT systems that maintain constant output voltage against coupling and load variations. In this paper, an efficiency evaluation method is put forward to evaluate the closed-loop control schemes. Furthermore, a maximum efficiency point tracking control scheme is proposed to maximize the system efficiency while regulating the output voltage. This control scheme is unique and prominent in that it fixes the operating frequency at the receiving-side resonant frequency and converts both the input voltage and the load resistance at the same time. Thus, the maximum efficiency point on the constant output voltage trajectory can be tracked dynamically. Therefore the system's output voltage can be maintained constant and its efficiency is always the highest. The experimental results show that the maximum efficiency point is tracked and a very high overall efficiency is achieved over wide ranges of coupling coefficient and load resistance.},

abstract = {Wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance coupling method has opened a new possibility to the electric vehicle system. It allows the wireless charging system of moving vehicles, using charging lanes. However, although the efficiency of power transmission is relatively high, the efficiency still depends on displacement of coils. There have been several researches on methods to maintain power transmission at the highest efficiency. However, in such systems, the information on system parameter especially coupling coefficients is needed, and in the charging lane system, such information is unlikely to be obtainable without a communication system. Therefore, it has come to attention that parameter estimation is a crucial factor to implement a charging lane system. This paper presents derivations of equations for estimating coupling coefficients in several configurations of wireless power transfer system, using information from only one side, either the transmitting side or the receiving side, of the system. The presented equations are both applicable to the case of single receiving coil and are also generalized for the case of multiple receiving coils. Each equation is verified by both simulations and experiments. An experimental system of the coupling coefficient estimation system is constructed for estimation from the receiving side using a dc/dc converter.},

abstract = {Conventional near field inductive wireless power transfer theory shows that systems suffer from splitting frequency behaviors when strong coupling condition exists between the transmitter and the receiver. However, this characteristic has not been explored for communication. Our analysis demonstrates that the splitting behaviour of frequency creates multiple frequencies that support inductive communication in MIMO configuration. As a result, we implement a binary chirp modulation on an FPGA and validate two channel communication using splitting. This paper introduces the use of chirp signals to spread data and excite inductive MIMO systems. The simulation and experiment show that the splitting frequency depends on a quality factor and the flux coupling condition between the data source and receiver. In other words, the degree of mutual coupling defines the splitting mode. This paper proves that multi-channel communication using splitting can be used for data transmission. The results show that data rates of 50 Mbps or 69 Kbps can be achieved for each channel between the transmitters and receivers when the transmitter and receiver operate at the original resonant frequency of 13.56 MHz or 28 KHz, respectively and the distance between them varies from about 1 cm to 10 cm.},

In this paper, a general approach is presented to identify the power transfer capability and bifurcation phenomena (multiple operating modes) for such systems. This is achieved using a high order mathematical model consisting of both primary and secondary resonant circuits. The primary compensation is deliberately designed to make the primary zero phase angle frequency equal the secondary resonant frequency to achieve maximum power with minimum VA rating of the supply. A contactless electric vehicle battery charger was used to validate the theory by comparing the measured and calculated operational frequency and power transfer. For bifurcation-free operation, the power transfer capability and controllability are assured by following the proposed bifurcation criteria. Where controllable operation within the bifurcation region is achievable, a significant increase in power is possible.},

abstract = {Drug resistance is a growing problem that necessitates new strategies to combat pathogens. Neutrophil phagocytosis and production of intracellular ROS, in particular, has been shown to cooperate with antibiotics in the killing of microbes. This study tested the hypothesis that p85alpha, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, regulates production of intracellular ROS. Genetic knockout of p85alpha in mice caused decreased expression of catalytic subunits p110alpha, p110beta, and p110delta, but did not change expression levels of the NADPH oxidase complex subunits p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox. When p85alpha, p55alpha, and p50alpha (all encoded by Pik3r1) were deleted, there was an increase in intracellular ROS with no change in phagocytosis in response to both Fcgamma receptor and complement receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the increased intracellular ROS correlated with significantly improved neutrophil killing of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Our findings suggest inhibition of p85alpha as novel approach to improving the clearance of resistant pathogens.},

This paper aims at providing a general analysis on the multiple-receiver WPT systems and compensation for the influence of the cross coupling. A two-receiver WPT system is first investigated as an example. It shows that theoretically by having derived optimal load reactances the important system characteristics can be preserved such as the original system efficiency, input impedance, and power distribution when there is no cross coupling between receivers. The discussion is then extended to general multiple-receiver WPT systems with more than two receivers. Similar results are obtained that show the possibility of compensating the cross coupling by having the derived optimal load reactances. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated by model-based calculation and final experiments using real two-and three-receiver systems.},

abstract = {Effective means of delivering wireless power to volumes of spaces will enable users the freedom and mobility to seamlessly power and recharge their devices in an unencumbered fashion. This has particular importance for consumer electronic, medical, and industrial applications, where usage models focus on unstructured and dynamic environments. However, existing wireless power technology falls short of this vision. Inductive charging solutions are limited to near-contact distances and require a docking station or precise placement for effective operation. Far-field wireless power techniques allow much greater range, but require complicated tracking systems to maintain a line-of-sight connection for high-efficiency power delivery to mobile applications. Recent work using magnetically coupled resonators (MCRs) for wireless power delivery has shown a promising intersection between range (on the order of a meter), efficiency (over 80{\%}), and delivered power (up to tens of watts). However, unpredictable loads rapidly change system operating points, and changes in position disrupt system efficiency, which affects the ultimate usability of these systems. Dynamic adaptation to these changes in operating conditions and power transfer range is a critical capability in developing a fully functional and versatile wireless power solution. This paper provides an overview of methods used to adapt to variations in range, orientation, and load using both wideband and fixed-frequency techniques.},

A general analysis of such LCIPT systems is essential for optimal system design. This analysis is undertaken for LCIPT systems that attempt to operate with zero phase angles between the primary input voltage and current in order to achieve minimum cost and maximum performance. The paper develops general boundary conditions that if followed ensures only one operating condition exists for any practical load thereby assuring stable operation and power transfer capability.

abstract = {An integrated transceiver design suitable for short range wireless applications, such as RFID or the transmission of data from medical sensors, is presented. Fabricated in a standard 0.13-$\mu$m CMOS process, the test chips include the transceiver, the integrated antenna, the phase-locked loop (PLL) loop filter and supply decoupling. The transmitter and receiver consist of PLLs operated in both closed– and open-loop modes. Initially closed, the transmit PLL phase locks an RF voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), the loop is subsequently opened and the VCO is modulated to yield an FM output signal that radiates directly from the tank inductor that doubles as the integrated antenna. The closed-loop receiver phase locks an RF VCO which, in open-loop mode, is injection locked to the incoming FM signal and the PLL components serve to demodulate the signal. Averaged transmit and receive power consumptions are less than 1.1 mW, enabling on-chip ultracapacitors to serve as the power source. When one chip communicates using the on-chip antenna to another chip connected to an off-chip patch antenna the communication range is 1.8 m at 5 kb/s. The communication range can be increased at the expense of the data rate, or by using off-chip antennas with both chips. {\textcopyright} 2008, IEEE. All rights reserved.},

These are generally acceptable in benign environments, but can be unsafe or have limited life in the presence of moisture. In explosive atmospheres and in undersea applications, special connectors must be used. This paper describes a technique, the contactless energy transfer system (CETS), by which electrical energy may be transmitted, without electrical connection or physical contact, through nonmagnetic media of low conductivity. The CETS, which has been used to transfer up to 5 kW across a 10-mm gap, employs high-frequency magnetic coupling and enables plug-in power connections to be made in wet or hazardous environmental conditions without the risk of electric shock, short circuiting, or sparking. Energy may be transmitted without the necessity for accurately manufactured "plug-and-socket" mechanisms and may be transmitted from source to load, even when there is relative motion. Load-source voltage matching may be made inherent to the system. Index Terms-Contactless power transmission, electrical engineering power.},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges to power embedded devices using magnetically coupled resonant wireless power transfer (WPT) system is that the amount of power delivered to the load is very sensitive to load impedance variations. Previous adaptive impedance-matching (IM) technologies have drawbacks because adding IM networks, relay coils, or other compensating components in the receiver-side will significantly increase the receiver size. In this paper, a novel frequency-tracking and impedance-matching combined system is proposed to improve the robustness of wireless power transfer for embedded devices. The characteristics of the improved WPT system are investigated theoretically based on the two-port network model. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out to validate the proposed system. The results suggest that the frequency-tracking and impedance-matching combined WPT system can quickly find the best matching points and maintain high power transmission efficiency and output power when the load impedance changes.},

abstract = {Recently, a digital baseband receiver called zero-intermediate frequency zero-crossing demodulator (ZIFZCD) was developed for digital FM signal detection. ZIFZCD is applicable to many worldwide mobile and personal communications systems. In addition, ZIFZCD offers lower power consumption and simpler implementation, compared to the conventional analog implementation [e.g., a limiter-discriminator integrator and dump (LDI)] and the conventional digital implementation [e.g., the cross-differentiate-mulliply demodulator (CDM)]. An objective of this paper is to introduce the ZIFZCD and report the bit-error rate (BER) of the ZIFZCD under both static and fading environments. The analyzed and simulated BER results show that the ZIFZCD is comparable to the conventional CDM for a narrowband digital FM with modulation index 0.5, and the ZIFZCD is significantly better than the CDM for a wideband digital FM with modulation index larger than 1.5. {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting for wireless communication networks is a new paradigm that allows terminals to recharge their batteries from external energy sources in the surrounding environment. A promising energy harvesting technology is wireless power transfer where terminals harvest energy from electromagnetic radiation. Thereby, the energy may be harvested opportunistically from ambient electromagnetic sources or from sources that intentionally transmit electromagnetic energy for energy harvesting purposes. A particularly interesting and challenging scenario arises when sources perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), as strong signals not only increase power transfer but also interference. This article provides an overview of SWIPT systems with a particular focus on the hardware realization of rectenna circuits and practical techniques that achieve SWIPT in the domains of time, power, antennas, and space. The article also discusses the benefits of a potential integration of SWIPT technologies in modern communication networks in the context of resource allocation and cooperative cognitive radio networks.},

abstract = {The next generation of implantable high-power neuroprosthetic devices such as visual prostheses and brain computer interfaces are going to be powered by transcutaneous inductive power links formed between a pair of printed spiral coils (PSC) that are batch-fabricated using micromachining technology. Optimizing the power efficiency of the wireless link is imperative to minimize the size of the external energy source, heating dissipation in the tissue, and interference with other devices. Previous design methodologies for coils made of 1-D filaments are not comprehensive and accurate enough to consider all geometrical aspects of PSCs with planar 3-D conductors as well as design constraints imposed by implantable device application and fabrication technology. We have outlined the theoretical foundation of optimal power transmission efficiency in an inductive link, and combined it with semi-empirical models to predict parasitic components in PSCs. We have used this foundation to devise an iterative PSC design methodology that starts with a set of realistic design constraints and ends with the optimal PSC pair geometries. We have executed this procedure on two design examples at 1 and 5 MHz achieving power transmission efficiencies of 41.2{\%} and 85.8{\%}, respectively, at 10-mm spacing. All results are verified with simulations using a commercial field solver (HFSS) as well as measurements using PSCs fabricated on printed circuit boards.},

Coupled resonators are first analyzed by the harmonic resonance analysis (HRA), and the F-parameter resonance analysis (FRA) methods to obtain the input impedance and voltage gain vs. the operating frequency. After that, the total circuit including the switching transistors and rectifying diodes is analyzed by the switching converter analysis tool (SCAT). The estimated voltage gain by the FRA method is well duplicated in the total zero volt switching (ZVS) circuit simulation including the semiconductor devices by SCAT. Thus, the coupled coil resonators analysis is for the first time utilized to analyze the total high-efficiency ZVS WPT system.},

By introducing the time-domain load modulated transmitter for FSK instead of the conventional current-driven scheme, energy reduction of the transmitter side is possible. For verifying the proposed scheme, a test chip was fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, and two chips were stacked for verifying the inter-chip communication. The measurement results show 0.64 fJ/bit transmitter power consumption while its input voltage is 60 mV, and the communication distance is 150 $\mu$m. The footprint of the transmitter is 0.0016 mm2},

abstract = {A high data-rate frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation protocol, a wideband inductive link, and three demodulator circuits have been developed with a data-rate-to-carrier-frequency ratio of up to 67{\%}. The primary application of this novel FSK modulation/demodulation technique is to send data to inductively powered wireless biomedical implants at data rates in excess of 1 Mbps, using comparable carrier frequencies. This method can also be used in other applications such as radio-frequency identification tags and contactless smartcards by adding a back telemetry link. The inductive link utilizes a series-parallel inductive-capacitance tank combination on the transmitter side to provide more than 5 MHz of bandwidth. The demodulator circuits detect data bits by directly measuring the duration of each received FSK carrier cycle, as well as derive a constant frequency clock, which is used to sample the data bits. One of the demodulator circuits, digital FSK, occupies 0.29 mm2 in the AMI 1.5-$\mu$m, 2M/2P, standard CMOS process, and consumes 0.38 mW at 5 V. This circuit is simulated up to 4 Mbps, and experimentally tested up to 2.5 Mbps with a bit error rate of 10-5, while receiving a 5/10-MHz FSK carrier signal. It is also used in a wireless implantable neural microstimulation system. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

Powering systems at a distance using lasers to either recharge batteries or run devices offers significant advantages. Using remote lasers can untether the user, unburden the individual from transporting extra batteries, as well as eliminate the down time associated with recall of critical assets for related battery swap-out and charging. In this paper, we focus on selecting a wavelength and power level that can be implemented with relative safety margins for transmission of electrical power at distances for energizing unmanned systems. We shall also discuss the planning, laser selection and testing, laser hazard analysis and the detector selection for a laser based power transfer system.},
